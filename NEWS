Bootloader:

  1. The previous version had a bug: you could not load a program on
  top of a previously loaded one. To do that we need to erase the
  flash memory before writing the new program. The new version does
  this.

  2. The code related to the PIC has been moved to another MPLABX
  project, feb.X. There is still some PIC-specific code in uart.c,
  related to the configuration of the UART.

  3. Definitions for synchronization states between the PC and the PIC
  have been added in states.h.

  4. Using stdint.h for type width clearness.

  5. Does not execute loaded program in the end. For that to happen, a
  specific command must be given.

  6. The flash memory writes are now being verified (read and compare
  after write).

Loader:

  1. Added command for executing the loaded program.

  1. Added command for rebooting the PIC.

  2. Added debug switch.
